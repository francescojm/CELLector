Description: Functions to select the most relevant cancer cell lines to be included in a new in-vitro study, in a genomic-guided fashion. CELLector combines methods from graph theory and market basket analysis; it leverages tumour genomics data to explore, rank, and select optimal cell line models in a user-friendly way, enabling scientists to make appropriate and informed choices about model inclusion/exclusion in retrospective analyses and future studies. Additionally, it allows the selection of models within user-defined contexts, for example, by focusing on genomic alterations occurring in biological pathways of interest or considering only predetermined sub-cohorts of cancer patients. Finally, CELLector identifies combinations of molecular alterations underlying disease subtypes currently lacking representative cell lines, providing guidance for the future development of new cancer models.
