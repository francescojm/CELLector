\title{
Pan-Cancer/Cancer-Specific RACSs map.
}
\description{
A data frame mapping chromosomal regions of recurrent copy number amplifications/deletions in cancer (RACSs, as defined in [1]) identified via ADMIRE [2] in the context of specific cancer types to PanCancer RACSs.
}
\usage{data("CELLector.CFEs.CNAid_mapping")}
\format{
  A data frame with 425 observations (one for each PanCancer RACS) and a column for each of 27 different cancer types (specified by
  TCGA labels). The entry in position \emph{i,j} contains the identifier of the \emph{i}th PanCancer RACS in the context of the \emph{j}th
  cancer type (where available).
