\title{
Derive signatures underlying the cancer patients' subtypes in the CELLector search space
}
\description{
This function takes in input the CELLector search space encoded as a binary tree in a \emph{navigable table}. Then, for each individual path (from the root to a node) of this tree it derives a rule (signature), represented as a logic AND of multiple terms (or their negation), one per each node in the path. Negations are added when right branches are encountered.

\usage{
CELLector.createAllSignatures(NavTab)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{NavTab}{
    A CELLector searching space encoded as binary tree in a navigable table, as returned by the \code{CELLector.Build_Search_Space} function.
}
}
\value{
  A list with two vectors of strings and a numerical vector. Each element of the first two vectors represent a signature of cancer functional events (CFEs, defined in [1]) corresponding to a node in the CELLector searching space. This is expressed as a logic formula (rule), which a cancer patient's genome must satisfy in order to be included in the sub-population represented by the node under consideration. The first vector (\code{S}) contains decoded signatures, i.e. where the CFEs involving copy number alterations are represented by a genomic loci and contained cancer driver genes. The second vector (\code{ES}) contains signatures of CFEs as they are represented in the binary event matrix containing the patients genomic data used to build the CELLector searching space. Further deatils are provided in [2]. The third vector (\code{STS}) contains the percentage of cancer patients belonging to the subtype represented by the signatures.
